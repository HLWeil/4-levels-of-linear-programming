## Introduction

You have been contacted by the FSharp Corporation, a thriving business that 
ships FSharp all over countries of the European Union.  

Each country needs a steady monthly supply of FSharp. A smaller country like 
Austria needs to receive 10 units of F# each month, whereas a larger country 
like Germany needs 57 units of F# each month.  

The FSharp Corporation operates 5 factories, spread out in the European Union. 
Each factory can produce a limited quantity of F# units every month, and is 
assigned a list of countries it can ship to.  

However, due to an increase in F# demand, Management has noticed that there 
were issues with producing and shipping units where they are needed. Your task 
is to analyze the setup, and optimize it!
